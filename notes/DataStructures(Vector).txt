firstly, let 100 be the length of the vector
it will change its size to 2 * first size when there is no space for other push_backs
it will also change its size to 1/2 * first size when there is too much empty space after pop_backs

increasing space involves a new pointer which will contain all data from first pointer and will have double length
decreasing as same as increasing will use an auxiliar pointer which will contain all data from first pointer and will have halved length

de facut doua functii private care dubleaza/injumatatesc m_capacity (cum mai exact le fac)
front si back cu eroarea aia

f(int x = 0) pun doar le definire
